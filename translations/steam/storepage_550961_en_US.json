Therefore, you must focus on thoughtful planning and strategic placement of your armies.[\/p]\n\n[p]Individual units micromanagement is avoided wherever possible. Units have no user-activated skills. Just attack-move or leave them alone, and the units will do the best, on their own.[\/p]\n\n[p]Also ensure protection of your supply lines.[\/p]\n\n[h2]Any-Shape 3D Maps[\/h2]\n\n[p][img src=&quot;{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}\/extras\/maps.gif&quot;][\/img]Play on the surface of any 3D shape, such as a planet, potato, horseshoe, or gear. Perhaps several islands floating in void connected with small bridges. Perhaps a stuck clockwork.[\/p]\n\n[p]Most places can be ambushed from many directions. Units may shoot across void, if visible and in range.[\/p]\n\n[p]Determining the strategic value of various positions on the map is a crucial skill to master the game.[\/p]\n\n[h2]Resources In The World[\/h2]\n\n[p][img src=&quot;{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}\/extras\/resources.jpg&quot;][\/img][\/p]\n\n[p]There is over a dozen types of resources: raw ores, intermediate goods, and military parts.[\/p]\n\n[p]All resources are on pallets or in boxes, existing directly in the world, and requiring transportation. Trucks are controlled automatically.[\/p]\n\n[p]UW has no technology tree or research. Progression is achieved through acquiring or refining new resources.[\/p]\n\n[h2]Virtual Reality[\/h2]\n\n[p][img src=&quot;{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}\/extras\/virtual-reality.gif&quot;][\/img]The unique maps of Unnatural Worlds make the game a perfect fit for virtual reality, marking it the first RTS game in VR.[\/p]\n\n[p]You hold the world in one hand and issue commands to your units with the other hand.[\/p]\n\n[p]Cross-play is possible.[\/p]\n",
